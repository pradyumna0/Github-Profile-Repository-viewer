- The JavaScript code utilizes vanilla JavaScript, which means it does not rely on any external libraries or frameworks.
- The search functionality is implemented using event listeners to detect user input in the search box.
- Upon submitting a search query, the script makes an Fetch API call to the GitHub API endpoint to fetch user details and repository information.
- The fetched user details include the username, avatar (profile picture), bio, and the total count of repositories owned by the user.
- Pagination is implemented to handle cases where the user has a large number of repositories. This ensures that the repository list is divided into manageable chunks for easier navigation.
- Each page of repositories typically contains around 10 repositories, allowing users to browse through the list without overwhelming them with too much information at once.
- The pagination controls, such as "Previous" and "Next" buttons, enable users to navigate between different pages of repositories seamlessly.
- The script enhances user interaction and engagement by providing a smooth and intuitive browsing experience for exploring GitHub repositories.
